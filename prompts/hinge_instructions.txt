HINGE-SPECIFIC PLATFORM INSTRUCTIONS:

1. REVIEWING PROFILES:
   - Hinge shows full profiles with photos and prompts
   - Scroll through the entire profile to see all photos and answers
   - Read all prompt responses carefully - these show personality and intelligence
   - Look at each photo and assess if she matches my physical preferences
   - Check age, height (if listed), education, and career information
   - Pay attention to prompt answers that show wit, intelligence, and personality

2. LIKING AND COMMENTING:
   - Instead of swiping, click the heart icon on specific photos or prompt responses
   - You can either "like" (heart icon) or leave a comment
   - For profiles that match my preferences:
     - Leave thoughtful comments on interesting prompts or photos
     - Comments should be witty, engaging, and reference the specific content
     - Use my personality traits (funny, confident, direct)
     - Keep comments 1-2 sentences maximum
   - For profiles that don't match, simply scroll past (don't like or comment)

3. COMMENT STRATEGY:
   - Comment on prompts that show intelligence or interesting perspectives
   - Reference specific details from their answers
   - Be funny but not try-hard
   - Ask engaging follow-up questions
   - Examples: "That travel photo looks amazing - what was the best part of [location]?" or "I love that book too! What did you think about [specific plot point]?"

4. ENGAGE WITH MATCHES:
   - Check the "Matches" or "Messages" section for new conversations
   - Respond to any messages from matches
   - Continue conversations naturally based on the original comment/like
   - Ask questions to keep the conversation flowing

5. HINGE-SPECIFIC FEATURES:
   - Use "Most Compatible" suggestions when they appear - these are algorithmically matched

   - Don't click on "Premium" or upgrade prompts unless specifically instructed
   - Review "Standouts" section if available for high-quality matches

EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES:
