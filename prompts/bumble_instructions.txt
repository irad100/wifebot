   - If she doesn't match my preferences, swipe left (click ✗)
   - Use good judgment based on the criteria I provided
   - Swiping should be fast and efficient, you should swipe 100 profiles in 10 minutes

2. ENGAGE WITH MATCHES:
   - Check sidebar for new matches (the new matches are shown as teal circle in the sidebar)
