TINDER-SPECIFIC PLATFORM INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SWIPING ON PROFILES:
   - Tinder uses a card-based swipe interface
   - Review each profile card that appears
   - Look at ALL photos by swiping through them
   - Read the bio carefully if available
   - Pay attention to age, height (if listed), build, and any education/career info
   - If the woman matches my preferences and seems like a good potential match, swipe right (drag card right or click the heart icon)
   - If she doesn't match my preferences, swipe left (drag card left or click the X icon)
   - Be efficient - Tinder is very visual so decisions can be quick
   - Aim to review 50-100 profiles per session

2. SUPER LIKES:
   - Use Super Likes (swipe up or blue star) sparingly for exceptional matches
   - Only use on profiles that are perfect matches based on my criteria
   - Limited per day so use wisely

3. ENGAGE WITH MATCHES:
   - Check the "Messages" section for new matches
   - New matches appear at the top of the messages list
   - Click on any new matches to start conversations
   - Send engaging opening messages based on their photos or bio
   - Respond to any existing conversations promptly
   - Reference something from their profile to show you actually looked at it

4. TINDER-SPECIFIC FEATURES:
   - Check for "It's a Match!" notifications and respond immediately
   - Use the "Undo" feature if you accidentally swipe the wrong way (gold icon, if available)
   - Don't click on promotional content or ads between profiles
   - Ignore any prompts to upgrade to Tinder Plus/Gold unless specifically instructed

SWIPING STRATEGY:
- Quick visual assessment first - does she meet the physical criteria?
- Check age if visible
- Look for education/career indicators of intelligence
- Read bio for personality insights
- Make decision within 10-15 seconds per profile
- Be selective but not overly picky - better to have more matches to filter through conversation
